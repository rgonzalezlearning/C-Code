// The program above displays a bear face using ASCII art. The bear face is made up of various characters, such as backslashes, forward slashes, and underscores. The printf() function is used to display each line of the bear face, and the escape sequence \n is used to move to the next line after each printf() call. The result is a simple, but recognizable, representation of a bear face.
// The program starts by including the standard input/output library, stdio.h. The main() function is then defined, and a series of printf() calls are used to display the bear face. Finally, the main() function returns 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
// The bear face is displayed as follows:
//   ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
//   \\\|||///
//    \\|||//
//     ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
//      \|/
// The bear face is made up of the following characters:
//   - ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ: The bear's face and ears
//   - \\\|||///: The bear's arms
//   - \\|||//: The bear's body
//   - ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ: The bear's paws
//   - \|/: The bear's feet and tail
